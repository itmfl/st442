# The R environment
R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes
+ an effective data handling and storage facility,
+ a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
+ a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
+ graphical facilities for data analysis and display.
+ a well-developed, simple and effective programming language.
+ effective tools for **literate programming**, e.g., creating a report that seamlessly weave code/data together with formulas, texts, documentation. In fact, these slides are written in *Rmarkdown*.


+ The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software. R can be extended (easily) via packages. 

+ There are many (>10,000) **R libraries** that 
are available through the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) repositories.

]
---
class: clear
Every vector in **R** has two key properties.

.pull-left[
+ type: determine via **typeof()**
```{r}
typeof(c("A","B","C"))
typeof(1:10)
library(nycflights13)
typeof(flights)
typeof(NULL)
```
]
.pull-right[ 
+ length: determine via **length()**
```{r}
length(letters)
length(1:10)
length(flights)
length(NULL)
```
]

---
#Type of atomic vectors

Vectors are created in **R** using the function $\mathtt{c()}$ for combine.

+ Logical: simplest type of vector. Three values ( $\mathtt{TRUE}$, $\mathtt{FALSE}$ and $\mathtt{NA}$).
```{r}
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, NA, T, F)
```

+ Numeric: Elements are integers or doubles (default). 
Note that doubles representation are only approximations.
```{r}
c(typeof(1), typeof(1L), typeof(1.5L))
```
.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- sqrt(2)^2; x; x - 2
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
c(x == 2, dplyr::near(x,2))
```
]

---
class: clear
+ Special values (avoid using $==$ to check for special values)
    + $\mathtt{NA}$: integer and double; check with $\mathtt{is.na}$ 
    + $\mathtt{Inf}$ and $-\mathtt{Inf}$: double; check with $\mathtt{is.infinite()}$       
    + $\mathtt{NaN}$: double; check with $\mathtt{is.nan()}$ or $\mathtt{is.na()}$.
```{r}
c(-1,0,1)/0
NA*(c(-1,0,1)/0)
```

+ Characters: each element of a character vector is itself a string. 
```{r}
x <- c("A string","A longer string", "Even longer string")
typeof(x); length(x)

```
---
class: clear

+ The types are, from least to most general, 
$$ \mathtt{logical} \rightarrow \underbrace{\mathtt{integer} \rightarrow \mathtt{double}}_{\mathtt{numeric}} \rightarrow  \mathtt{character} $$
+ Explicit coercion is via: $\mathtt{as.logical()}$, $\mathtt{as.numeric()}$, $\mathtt{as.integer()}$, $\mathtt{as.double()}$, $\mathtt{as.character()}$. 

+ Implicit coercion: $\mathtt{TRUE}$ and $\mathtt{FALSE}$ are coerced to $1\mathrm{L}$ and $0\mathrm{L}$. On occasions, positive integer is coerced to $\mathtt{TRUE}$ and $0$ is coerced to $\mathtt{FALSE}$
```{r}
x <- 3
if(length(x)){
  x <- rep(x, 2)
}
x
```

---
class: clear

+ All atomic vectors need to be of the same type, e.g.,
```{r}
typeof(c(TRUE, 1L))
typeof(c(1L,1))
typeof(c("1",1))
```
---
#Vector recycling rules
Basic mathematical operations are **vectorized** in **R**. In the case where the vectors appearing in the operations are not of the same length, **R** will automatically recycle/repeated the shorter vector to be of the same length as the longer vector (with a possible warning message)
```{r warning = TRUE}
x <- 1:10; x
x + 1
x*2
x^2

```

---
class: clear
```{r}
sqrt(x)
x + 1:2
x + 1:3
```
For explicit recycling/repetition, use $\mathtt{rep()}$, e.g.,
```{r}
rep(1:2, times = 5)
rep(1:2, each = 5)
rep(1:3, times = c(2,3,4))
```

---
# Naming elements of a vector
```{r}
c(x = 1,y = 2, z = 3)
w <- c(1,2,3)
w
names(w) <- c("x", "y", "z")
w
```

---
#Subsetting elements
Vectors are subset in **R** using the `[` function. There are four type of things that can appear within `[`
+ A numeric vector containing only integers. The integers must either be **all** non-negative or **all** non-positive

.pull-left[
```{r error = TRUE}
x <- 1:10
x[c(3,2,5)]
x[c(3,3,2,5,5)]
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r error = TRUE, linewidth=50}
x[0]
x[c(0,-2,-4)]
```
]

```{r error = TRUE}
x[c(1,-2,-4)]
```
---
class: clear
+ Subsetting with a logical vector $v$ keeps **all** values corresponding to a $\mathtt{TRUE}$ value in $v$ (and add missing values if there are missing values in $v$) e.g.,
```{r}
x%%2 == 0
x[x%%2 == 0]
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, NA, FALSE, TRUE)]
```
---
class: clear

+ use $\mathtt{which}$ to find indices of a logical vector with $\mathtt{TRUE}$ values, e.g.,
```{r}
which(x %% 2 == 0)
which(c(TRUE, FALSE, NA, FALSE, TRUE))
```

+ If the vector has names then you can subset it with a character vector, e.g.,
```{r}
w <- c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3)
w[c("x","z","z","x")]
```
---
class: clear
+ Finally, you can extract all the elements with `[]` or a single element with `[[]]`, e.g.,
```{r error = TRUE}
x <- 1:10
x[]
x[[1]]
x[[c(1,2)]]
```
---
#Recursive vectors (lists)
Lists are non-atomic vectors whose elements are themselves possibly other lists. Thus, the elements of a list could have different type, e.g.,

.pull-left[
```{r error = TRUE}
u <- list(1,2,3)
u
v <- list(c(1,2,3))
v
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r error = TRUE}
x <- list(1,2,"NA")
x
y <- list(c(1,2,"NA"))
y
```
]
---
class: clear
```{r}
w <- list(u,v,x,y)
length(w)
str(w)
```
---
#Extracting elements from a list
```{r}
a <- list(a = 1:3, b = "a string", c = pi, d = list(-1, -5))
str(a)
```

There are three ways to subset a list, namely `[`, `[[` and `$`.
+ `[` will always extract a sub-list and hence returns another list.
.pull-left[
```{r}
str(a[1:2])
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
str(a[4])
```
]

---
class: clear
+ `[[` will always extract a **single element** from a list and 
hence removes a level of nesting. 

```{r error = TRUE}
str(a[[4]])
a[[c(4,1)]]
a[[4]][[1]] ## Equivalent to the above
a[[4]][1] #Not equivalent to the above
```


---
class: clear
+ `$` will always extract a **single named element** from a list.
```{r}
str(a$d)
str(a[["d"]])
str(a["d"])
```

---
class: clear
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap = "Section 20.5 of R4DS"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2f3f752cae25018554d484464f117e600ff365a2/37627/diagrams/lists-subsetting.png")
```
---
#Vectors and attributes
Any vector can contain arbitrary metadata through its attributes. Attributes allows us to implement (fancy?) data structures using vectors as bases, e.g.,
```{r}
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L); x
typeof(x); attributes(x)
```
---
```{r}
class(x) <- "Date"; x
typeof(x); attributes(x)
attr(x,"Greetings") <- "Welcome to 442"
attributes(x)
```

---
class: clear

.pull-left[
```{r}
y <- 1:6; y
typeof(y); attributes(y)
names(y) <- c("M","T","W",
              "Th","F","Sat")
y
attributes(y)

```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
 ## similar to dim(y) <- c(3,2)
attr(y, "dim") <- c(3,2)
y
y["M"]
typeof(y); attributes(y)

```
]
---
class: clear

The three most important attributes of a vector are
+ **names** for naming the elements
+ **dimensions** or dims to make a vector behave like a matrix or aray
+ **class** is for implementing the S3 object-oriented system (see Hadley's Wickham [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html) for the gory details of **R** numerous objected-oriented systems).

Attributed vectors are used to implement *factors*, dates and times and data frames.
---
#Data frames
A data frame (in base **R**) is then simply a list whose elements are vectors, each of the same length. Consider the following $\mathtt{mtcars}$ data frame.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
typeof(mtcars)
```
---
class: clear
```{r}
length(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
```
---
class: clear
```{r}
attributes(mtcars)
```

---
#dplyr

We introduce the **dplyr** package written by Hadley Wickham, Roman Fran&ccedil;ois, Lionel Henry, and Kirill M&uuml;ller. This package is a core member of the **tidyverse** approach to data manipulation; the tidyverse provides a coherent framework for reading, pre-processing/wrangling, visualizing, and modeling data.

There are five main important *verbs* associated with dplyr, namely

+ [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html)
+ [select](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html)
+ [arrange](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html)
+ [mutate](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) and [rename](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/rename.html)
+ [group_by](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html) and [summarize](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html)

---
We follow an abbreviated presentation from Chapter 5 of [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). 

We first load the *flights13* dataset from the **nycflights13** package. This dataset describe the on-time data for all flights departing from NYC airports (i.e. JFK, LGA or EWA) in 2013.

```{r warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
flights
```
---
#filter()
Let us find flights departing NYC on August 21. Note that **dplyr** verbs takes a data frame and returns a new data frame.
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 8, day == 21)
## Equivalently: filter(flights, month == 8 & day == 21)
```
---
class: clear
Next, let us try to filter flights from August 21, 2013 that departs from either JFK or LGA.
```{r}
august21 <- filter(flights, month == 8 & day == 21)
filter(august21, origin == 'JFK' | origin == 'LGA') 
## Equivalently: filter(august21, origin %in% c("JFK","LGA"))
```
---
class: clear
Let us now check, among all the flights on August 21 from either JFK or LGA, which of them has a departure or arrival delay of 10 minutes or more.
```{r}
august21_jfk_lga <- filter(august21, origin %in% c("JFK","LGA"))
filter(august21_jfk_lga, arr_delay > 10 | dep_delay > 10)
```
---
class: clear
We can do all of the above filtering using a single chain sequence as follows
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month == 8 & day == 21) %>% 
            filter(origin %in% c("JFK","LGA")) %>%
            filter(arr_delay > 10 | dep_delay > 10)
```

+ The previous example introduce the `%>%` pipe operator. 

+ The pipe operator allows us to chain together operations without the need to introduce auxiliary variables.

+ The pipe operator maps `x %>% f(y)` to `f(x,y)`.

---
#Missing values
Missing values are represented in **R** as $\mathrm{NA}$; missing values are "contagious" hence any almost all operations involving one or more $\mathrm{NA}$ will also return a $\mathrm{NA}$. For example
```{r}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
2*NA
```
---
class: clear
Further examples include
```{r}
NA == NA
0*NA
NA^0
NA | TRUE
FALSE & NA
```
---
class: clear
**filter** only includes rows where the condition is $\mathrm{TRUE}$, i.e., it excludes rows with both $\mathrm{FALSE}$ and $\mathrm{NA}$ values. To preserve missing values, we have to ask for them explicitly, e.g.,
```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```
---
#arrange()
The *arrange* verb is similar to the *filter* verb, but instead of selecting rows, it reorder them according to some set of column names (or more complicated expressions). As an example, let us order the flights first by the three letter code for the airport destination, then by the date of flight.
```{r}
flights_dest <- select(flights, dest, everything()) 
arrange(flights_dest, dest, month, day)
```
---
class: clear
We can use **desc** to order a column in descending order, e.g.,
```{r}
arrange(flights_dest, desc(dest), month, day)
```
---
#select()
This verb is used to select a subset of columns (of variables). As an example, let us keep only the departure and arrival time of the flights.
```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, year, month, day, 
                      dep_time, sched_dep_time, 
                      arr_time, sched_arr_time)
flights_sml
```
---
class: clear
There are a few equivalent way to do the above selection, e.g.,
```{r}
names(flights)
## flights_sml <- select(flights, year:day, dep_time, 
##                       sched_dep_time, arr_time, sched_arr_time)
## flights_sml <- select(flights, year:day, contains("dep_time"),
##                       contains("arr_time"))
## flights_sml <- select(flights, year:day, contains("time"),
##                      -c(air_time,time_hour))
```
---
class: clear
We can also rename variables using *select*; however this will lead to the dropping of variables that are not explicitly mentioned. A better alternative is to use *rename*, e.g.,
```{r}
rename(flights_sml,
       departure_time = dep_time, arrival_time = arr_time)
```
---
class: clear
A useful helper function for use with select is the **everything()** function, which matches all variables. For example, to move a specific variable to the first column of data frame, we can do
```{r}
select(flights_sml, dep_time, everything())
```
---
# mutate()
The *mutate* verb is used to add new columns (that are possibly functions of existing columns) to a data frame; the new columns are always added as the last columns. For example
```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, year:day,ends_with("delay"),
                      distance, air_time)
mutate(flights_sml, gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
                    hours = air_time/60,
                    speed = distance/hours,
                    gain_per_hour = gain/hours) %>% select(-hours)
```
---
class: clear
A variant of *mutate* is *transmute*, which drops all variables except the newly created variables, e.g.,
```{r}
transmute(flights, gain = arr_delay - dep_delay, 
                   hours = air_time/60, 
                   gain_per_hour = gain/hours)
```
---
#summarize()
The *summarize* verb collapses a data frame to a single row. For example
```{r}
summarize(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay)) ## oops! missing values
summarize(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
---
class: clear
This is not terribly exciting. The power of *summarize* comes from its combination with **groub_by()**, allowing us to do *grouped summaries*, i.e., summary statistics on individual groups. For example
```{r}
flights %>% group_by(year, month, day)
```
---
class: clear
```{r}
flights %>% group_by(year, month, day) %>%
summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
---
class: clear
A more involved example is to compute the average distance and delay for flights to all destinations (except Honolulu).
```{r}
delays <- flights %>% group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(count = n(), 
            dist = mean(distance,na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_delay = mean(arr_delay + dep_delay,na.rm = TRUE)
            ) %>%
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
delays
```
---
class: clear
We can then plot how the average delay varies with the distance.
```{r message = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width='80%'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(delays, aes(x = dist, y  = avg_delay)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = count)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + ylab("average delay") + theme_bw()
```
---
class: clear
There are a large number of useful summary functions. See Section 5.6.4 of [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#summarise-funs). We provide a few more examples.
```{r}
## average arrival delay
not_canceled <- filter(flights, !is.na(dep_delay) & !is.na(arr_delay))
not_canceled %>% group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarize(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay), 
            avg_positive_delay = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay > 0]))
```
---
class: clear
```{r}
not_canceled %>% group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(dist_sd = sd(distance)) %>% arrange(desc(dist_sd))
```
---
class: clear
We note that *summarize* drops all variables except possibly those used to group the data and those variables introduced by the summary statistics. Contrasts the following two approaches
```{r}
not_canceled %>% group_by(year,month,day) %>%
  summarize(first_dep = first(dep_time), last_dep = last(dep_time))
```
---
class: clear
```{r}
not_canceled %>% group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  mutate(r = min_rank(desc(dep_time))) %>% filter(r %in% range(r))
```
---
# More examples
```{r}
not_canceled %>% group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(n_early = sum(dep_time < 500))
```
---
class: clear
```{r}
not_canceled %>% group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(long_delay_pct = mean(arr_delay > 60)) %>%
  arrange(desc(long_delay_pct))
```
---
class: clear
Finally, when you group by multiple variables, each call to $\mathrm{summary}$ peels off one level of the grouping, e.g.,
```{r}
daily <- group_by(flights, dest, month, day)
daily
```
---
class:clear
```{r}
daily %>% summarize(flights = n()) %>% 
          summarize(flights = sum(flights)) %>%
          summarize(flights = sum(flights)) 
```
---
class: clear
Be careful when peeling off nested groupings using a sequence of $\mathrm{summarize}$. 

Consider the following examples.

```{r echo = -1}
#options(tibble.print_max = 6, tibble.print_min = 4)
group_by(not_canceled, dest, month) %>%

#ungroup()
To remove grouping structure on grouped data, use $\mathrm{ungroup()}$, e.g.,
```{r}
daily <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarize(daily, flights = n())
daily %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(flights = n())
```
---
#grouped mutate + filter
We can also do a number of very useful operations by combining $\mathrm{group\_by}$ with either $\mathrm{filter}$ or $\mathrm{filter}$. For example
```{r message = TRUE}
## Find the worst flights with longest delay each day
flights_sml <- select(flights, year:day, ends_with("delay"),
                      distance, air_time)
flights_sml %>% group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) <= 10)
```
---
```{r}
## Find all popular destinations and compute
## proportion of total delay for each flights
flights %>% group_by(dest) %>%
  filter(n() > 365, arr_delay > 0) %>%
  mutate(prop_delay = arr_delay/sum(arr_delay)) %>%
  select(year:day, dest, arr_delay, prop_delay)
```
---
Functions that work most naturally in grouped mutates and grouped filters are [window functions](https://rpubs.com/hadley/window) (see the **R** command $\mathrm{vignette("window-functions")}$. 

The following example is from [window functions](https://rpubs.com/hadley/window). The example uses a dataset from the **Lahman** database that contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for MLB from $1871$ through $2018$. We will consider a sample of batting data for players that have won an award.
```{r}
library(Lahman)
batting <- Lahman::Batting %>% as_tibble() %>% 
           select(playerID, yearID, teamID, G, AB, R, H) %>%
           arrange(playerID, yearID, teamID) %>%
           semi_join(Lahman::AwardsPlayers, by = "playerID")
players <- batting %>% group_by(playerID)
```
---
Using this dataset, let us try a few $\mathrm{group\_mutate}$ and $\mathrm{group\_filter}$ operations. 
```{r}
## For each player, find the two years with most hits
filter(players, min_rank(desc(H)) <= 2 & H > 0)
```
---
class: clear
```{r}
## For each player, rank each year by the number of games played
mutate(players, G_rank = min_rank(G))
```
---
class: clear
```{r}
## For each player, find every year that was 
## better than the previous year
filter(players, AB > 0, lag(AB) > 0, H/AB > lag(H)/lag(AB))
```
---
class: clear
```{r}
# For each, player compute a z score based on number of games played
mutate(players, G_z = (G - mean(G)) / sd(G))
```
---
class: clear
The $\mathrm{ntile(x,m)}$ function divides the (numeric) vector $x$ into $m$ evenly sized buckets. The next operation divides the team players into $4$ coarse groups and calculate the batting average for each group.
```{r}
batting %>% group_by(teamID,playerID) %>%
  summarise(total_hits = sum(H), total_ab = sum(AB), 
            batting_avg = total_hits/total_ab) %>%
  filter(!is.na(batting_avg)) %>%
  mutate(quartile = ntile(batting_avg,4)) %>%
  group_by(teamID,quartile) %>% 
  summarise(batting_avg = sum(total_hits)/sum(total_ab))
```

#across() and multiple columns
The **dplyr** verbs such as **mutate** and **summarize** we saw previously can also be combined with the [across](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html) function to allow for doing the same operation on multiple columns. See also this [vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html).
.pull-left[
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(100), 
  y = runif(100), z = runif(100))
df
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
df %>% summarize(
  across(c(x,y,z),mean))
## Equivalently
## df %>% summarize(
##   across(everything(),mean))
```
]

---
class: clear

With **across **you can also 
+ apply multiple operations 
+ name the return values
+ select a subset of columns according to some condition

```{r}
df <- df %>% mutate(names = rep(letters,4)[1:100])
df
df %>% summarize(across(where(is.numeric),
                        list(mean = mean, sd = sd, ratio = ~max(.)/min(.))))

```

---
class: clear

The previous examples uses the $.$ operator, which serves as a placeholder for the variable/data of interest. See also the documentation for the [magrittr library](https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr). It is, however, generally cleaner (syntax wise), to define and use a named function as opposed to an anonymous function.

```{r}
max_min_ratio <- function(x){
  max(x)/min(x)
}
df %>% summarize(across(where(is.numeric),
                        list(mean = mean, sd = sd, ratio = max_min_ratio)))

# You can also combine multiple selection criteria
df %>% summarize(across(where(is.numeric) & c(-x),
                        list(mean = mean, sd = sd, ratio = max_min_ratio)))

## Equivalently
## df %>% summarize(across(c(y,z), 
##     list(mean = mean, sd = sd, ratio = max_min_ratio)))
```

---
class: clear

The following example shows the power of combining **across** with **group_by** and **mutate**. See this [blog post](https://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-07-09-across/) by 
R. Barter for more details. 
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
## Let us first count the number of species, number of island 
## and number of different sexes of the penguins
penguins %>% summarise(across(c(species, island, sex),n_distinct))

```

---
class: clear
```{r}
## Let us count the number of missing values in each columns
penguins %>% summarise(across(everything(),~sum(is.na(.))))
```

---
class: clear
```{r penguins}
## Replace missing values for the numerical variables by the 
## average value (computed within that specie and island).
library(dplyr)
penguins_imputed <- penguins %>%
  group_by(species, island) %>%
  mutate(imputed = if_any(where(is.numeric), is.na),
         across(where(is.numeric), 
                ~if_else(condition = is.na(.), 
                         true = mean(., na.rm = T), 
                         false = as.numeric(.)))) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  select(imputed, everything())

penguins_imputed
penguins_imputed %>% filter(imputed == TRUE)
```

---
class: clear

The **filter** verb does not work with **across**; we instead use the helpers [if_any](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html) and [if_all](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html).



```{r}
## Find all observations with at least one missing value
flights %>% filter(if_any(everything(), is.na))
```

---
class: clear
```{r}
## Find all flights with little delay
flights %>% filter(if_all(contains("delay"), ~ . < 10))
```

#dplyr::pull()
Finally, we discuss the use of the *pull* function to *extract* or *pull out* a variable/column from a data frame. Consider the following code.
```{r error = TRUE}
flights %>% select(arr_delay)
class(flights %>% select(arr_delay))
```
---
class: clear
```{r error = TRUE}
flights %>% pull(arr_delay) %>% head
class(flights %>% pull(arr_delay))
```
--
If we now extract the standard deviation from the above data frame/vector, we get
```{r error = TRUE}
flights %>% select(arr_delay) %>% sd(na.rm = TRUE)
flights %>% pull(arr_delay) %>% sd(na.rm = TRUE)
```

The difference in the above output is due to the fact that $\mathrm{sd}$ expects a *numeric* vector. Meanwhile, the *select* verb takes as input a *data frame* and ouputs another *data frame*. Since we want to extract the column $\mathrm{arr\_delay}$ ,we need to use $\mathrm{pull}$.
